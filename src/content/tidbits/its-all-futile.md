read this from "meditiation for mere mortals", this book i started reading (and gifted to my girlfriend). its aimed at helping internalize this concept called "imperfection", which aims to help us understand that the struggle for perfection is impossible and turns activities that are fun and exciting to chores to finish or games to beat. it aims to impart these thoughts over multiple days (a month specifically), to really try to internalize this concept. the first concept is the things we strive to accomplish (especially the lofty, ambitious, or ambiguous ones), are often impossible to achieve. and realizing this can be a freeing experience. there's a specific analogy, one of "focusing on a goal that is futile until the weight of it becomes so heavy we ultimately try to free ourselves from it" particularly poignant to me. 

some things i feel when it comes to this:

- being the closest friends to those i want to be close friends with
- being friends with people who are "cooler" than me
- finding a level of wealth at an early young age to run away from all financial problems
- learn enough to make sure that i can never feel insecure about my skills in (my job, my classes, etc)
- nevery hurting my girlfriend, never lying to my girlfriend

it's interesting, i will definitely be thinking about this more, and i especially appreciate the concept of this being a book that is meant to be read over a month, and "forcing" me to focus on one concept and internalize it. the pause is nice, the break is nice, and the **pause** is nice.
